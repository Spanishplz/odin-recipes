        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These tamales are delicious! I have been looking for a good tamales
        recipe for years. One day I went to the international market and stood
        in the Mexican aisle until a woman with a full cart came by. I just
        asked her if she knew how to make tamales. This is her recipe with a few
        additions from me! This is great served with refried beans and a salad.</p>

        <h2>Ingredient</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 &frac14 pork loin</li>
            <li>1 large onion, halved</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic</li>
            <li>4 dried chilli peppers</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1 &frac12 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package dried corn husks</li>
            <li>&frac23; cup lard</li>
            <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth, or as needed</li>
            <li>2 cups masa harina</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>&frac12; teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the filling: place pork, onion and garlic in a Dutch oven. Add enough water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat ot low and simmer until pork is cooked through, about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile make a chili sauce: user rubber gloves to remove stems and seeds from chiles. Place chiles in a saucepan with 2 cups of water. Simmer uncovered, for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.</li>
            <li>Transfer chiles and cooking water t a blender and blend until smooth. Strain mixture into a bowl and stir in salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Shred cooked pork and mix in 1 cup of chili sauce. Reserve remaining sauce for serving</li>
            <li>Prepare husks and dough: soak corn husks in a bowl of warm watter until softened, abound 30 minutes</li>
            <li>While husks are soaking, beat lard with 1 tablesoon broth until fluffy. Combine masa harina, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl; stir into the lard mixture, adding more broth as needed to form a spongy dough.</li>
            <li>Remove husks from water and pat dry. Spread dough out over husks to &frac14; to &frac12; inch thick</li>
            <li>Place 1 tablespoon of pork filling over center of each. Fold the sides, top and bottom of each husk in toward the center to enclose dough.</li>
            <li>Arrange tamales in steamer basket. Place over simmering water and steam for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Remove tamales from husks. Drizzle with remaining chile sauces and top with sour cream, or mix sour cream into the chile sauce first, for creamy sauce.</li>
        </ol>
